        "Summary of overall admissions Admission rates (per 1000 persons per year) by type are shown in Figure 29. The overall rate for adults with ID was 351.6 per 1000 persons per year, compared with 246.4 per 1000 persons per year for controls. This difference was essentially due to the higher rate among emergency admissions (182.2 vs. 67.7 per 1000 persons per year), as elective rates were similar between groups.\" p70, Carey et al (2017)\"\n",
